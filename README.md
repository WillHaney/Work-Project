# Personal-Project

# I was provided a SQL Database containing a list of approximately 7,000,000 permits related to U.S. pool construction and remodel activity dating back to the early 2000's. Using the SQL query you see here, I selected only relevant headers to make the results concise. Next, I wrote a where statement that limited the query results to a single primary construction permit (i.e., not associated trade permits for electrical, plumbing, etc.) for each swimming pool built from January 1, 2018, through current July 2023. I chose to order the data by the most recent date first making the results easier to follow. 

# Next, I imported the resulting dataset into Power BI. Using various filters and slicers, I created a report that produced the client-specified outputs.  Those outputs reveal the overall trend of pool construction through sliceable permit counts over the past 5 years with breakouts by time period, state, and permitting jurisdiction. I used features such as a line chart, matrix, and US heat map to display the results.
