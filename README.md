# Personal-Project

# I was provided a SQL Database containing a list of all permits relating to pool activity dating back to the early 2000's. Using the SQL query you see here, I selected only the relevant headers to make the results more consice. Next, I wrote a where statement that will produce all of the permits that were strictly used for pool building dating back to the year 2018. I chose to order the data by the most recent date first making the results easier to follow. 

# Lastly, I imported the entire dataset into Power BI. Using various filters and slicers, I created a report that demonstrates exactly what the client wanted. My client wanted to see the overall trend of pool building in the past 5 years and how the permit distribution varies from state to state. I used features such as a line chart, matrix, and US heat map to display these requests. Using my results, I was able to get even more specific and report permit frequency by each state jurisdiction.
